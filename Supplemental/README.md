# Powershell - Supplemental Scripts

This contains functions, projects, and code snippets which are useful to the powershell programmer or are not directly related to any one technical realm. Many of these scripts are included in other projects of mine but never really got published on their own. I thought it would be nice to separate them out for better maintainability and searching purposes.

Where possible I've attempted to give credit where credit is due but if I've repurposed some of your code and missed tagging it with your name/website please let me know.

##Code Inventory
Here is a short list of some of the code included in this directory.

* <b>ConvertTo-HashArray</b> - Convert an array of psobjects to a hash array based on one of the psobject properties. There are some interesting use case scenarios for such a function. See the example provided for usage.
