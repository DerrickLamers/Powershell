# Powershell - Supplemental -> Other Author

This contains functions, projects, and code snippets which have not be authored by myself. Many have been lightly to moderately modified at best. I don't actively maintain these scripts aside from whichever modifications I need to make to meet my own needs.

Where possible I've attempted to give credit where credit is due but if I've re-purposed some of your code and missed tagging it with your name/website please let me know.
