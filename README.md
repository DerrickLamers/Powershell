#Powershell Repository

This is an attempt to move all of my powershell script functions , snippets, and projects to one centralized repository. Over the course of the last few years I've amassed quite a few sysadmin related scripts. Over that same amount of time my powershell acumen has grown quite a bit. Unfortunately most of my older scripts have never been revisited and updated to reflect my new found best practices and knowlege. As I upload my scripts and projects I will do my best to get them updated. I welcome any suggestions, comments, or forks of this project.

Where possible I've attempted to give credit where credit is due but if I've re-purposed some of your code and missed tagging it with your name/website please let me know. In the same regards, if you find you are using my code in any of your efforts I'd appreciate being given appropriate credit where it is due.

##Description
This repository is broken down in to several broad areas which are subject to change. Currently I've included the following script directories:

*Active Directory
*Exchange
*Lync
*OS
*SQL
*Supplemental

The general mindset behind much of this code is to eliminate, as much as possible, outside dependencies and modules. Each function is mostly self sustaining. Where functions are not self sustaining I try to include the requirements inline to prevent complexity. At a later date I may look to implement some kind of automatic dependency resolution preparation script.
